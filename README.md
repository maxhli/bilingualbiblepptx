Bilingal Bible PPTX generator

This project started when my friend Steven Zhang asked me a question in 2015: Can we automate PPT slides making for the Chinese Congregation of Brentwood Baptist Church? Initially, I did not pay much attention to it and thought that it would be a difficult job. In 2016, When I joined Steven in making PPT slides, I realized that it was indeed a tedious job and we were be able to automate the process so that we can save time in a lot of copy and paste.

That remind me the Number 1 rule for starting an open source project: Solving your own problem at first.

Django/Python is used for the project since it is such a joy to work with Django.
